Hi, Iâ€™m Cole Simpson
I am a recent graduate from San Diego State University that received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I am looking for an entry level software development position where I can grow and improve my knowledge as a newfound 
computer scientist. Some of my interests include traveling, surfing, attending concerts, and rock climbing.
