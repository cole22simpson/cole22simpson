- 👋 Hi, I’m Cole Simpson
- 👀 I’m super into music, video games, making new friends, and travelling! I already used my computer so much that I decided I might as well make a career out of it!
- 🌱 I’m currently a student at SDSU studying Computer Science. I just recently finished a six month, full-stack web development bootcamp organized by the UC Berkeley Extension.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my knowledge much further than just web development to see what field I want to end up in down the line.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me by email at cole22simpson@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-simpson-0ba836105/).
